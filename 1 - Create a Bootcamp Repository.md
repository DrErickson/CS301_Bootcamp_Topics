# Create a copy of the bootcamp repository

The first step is to create a copy of the bootcamp repository.  This 
repository contains all the code, instructions, guides, etc needed for the 
bootcamp.  After you create a copy of the repository, you will be able to 
modify it as you wish.

* Navigate to the
  [bootcamp repository](https://github.com/DrErickson/CS301_Bootcamp_Topics).

* After that click on **"Use this template" &rarr; "Create a new repository"**

* Give your repository a name.
* Mark your repository public or private based on
  your preference.  Private means other people will not be able to find or
  view your repository.  Public will allow others to find and view your
  repository.
* Click **"Create repository from template"**
